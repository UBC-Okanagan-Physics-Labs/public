    "Electromagnetism can be unintuitive at times - this lab will help demonstrate a few principles from electromagnetism so that even if you think they are *strange*, you can at least clearly observe their effects.  Many of the concepts relevant to this lab have not been covered in the lecture yet.  That's okay.  In research, it's common for experimental work to predate a full theoretical understanding.  For example, superconductivity was first observed in mercury in 1911, but a theoretical understanding of the phenomenon wasn't fully developed until 1957 in the so-called BSC (Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer) Theory of Superconductivity.  A new class of *high-temperature* superconductors was discovered in 1987.  A microscope understanding of the mechanism driving superconductivity in these materials still eludes physicists to this day.\n",

    "Recall that electrical currents are a *source* of magnetic fields.  We will see that **Ampère's law** gives us a way to calculate the magnetic field produced by an arrangement of currents.  In Lab #7, we used the fact that a current in a solenoid produces a uniform magnetic field within the bore of the solenoid.  **Faraday's law** describes a complementary process in which magnetic fields produce electrical currents. Mathematically, this effect is expressed as:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\Phi_B$ is the **magnetic flux** through a closed conducting loop and $\\mathcal{E}$ is the **electromotive force** or **emf** produced in the loop.  The term **emf** is just used to represent a voltage *induced* by a changing magnetic flux.  The units of **emf** are volts: $[\\mathcal{E}]=\\rm\\ V$.  Notice from Eq. (1) that, if the magnetic flux $\\Phi_B$ is constant, then $\\mathcal{E}=0$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One important observation is that we now have a second way of producing voltage differences.  Previously, we always had to rely on batteries to provide a voltage difference to drive current in a circuit.  It now appears that a changing magnetic field (or more precisely, magnetic flux) can be used to establish a voltage differnce to drive current in a circuit.  This phenomenon is the basis for electric generators which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n",

    " A charge at rest produces no magetic field and a constant magnetic flux produces no emf.\n",

    "The magnetic flux through a surface is determined by the component of the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the surface.

    "In the first part of this lab, you will explore one effect of Faraday's Law of induction.  **Figure 5** shows a magnet sliding along a copper plate with velocity $\\vec{v}$. Since copper is a conductor, any circle embedded in the copper sheet can be considered a conducting loop.  The sliding magnet, and its magnetic field, are moving away from the loop on the left causing the magnetic flux through the left loop to *decrease*.  On the other hand, the magnet is approaching the loop on the right causing the magnetic flux to *increase* in this loop.  \n",

    "- The induced emfs drive currents $I_\\mathrm{ind}$ in the copper strip\n",
    "- The induced currents create their own magnetic fields $\\vec{B}_\\mathrm{ind}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lenz's law** states that the induced magnetic fields act to **oppose** the original change in magnetic flux.  In **Fig. 5**, the magnetic flux in the left loop is decreasing.  The original magnetic field due to the sliding magnet was pointing up.  $I_\\mathrm{ind}$ in this loop acts to oppose this change in flux and, hence, produces a $\\vec{B}_\\mathrm{ind}$ that also points *up*.  The situation is the opposite for the right loop:  The magnetic flux is increasing and the induced current creates a $\\vec{B}_\\mathrm{ind}$ that points *down* to oppose this change.  Little bar magnets have been added to the figure to emphasize the directions of the magnetic fields due to the sliding magnet and the left and right current loops.  The south pole at the bottom of the sliding magnet will be attracted to the north pole of the left current loop and repelled by the south pole of the right current loop.  As a result, even in the absence of friction, the sliding magnet will slow down and eventually come to a stop, a demostration of *magnetic braking*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt to model the magnetic braking force as a drag force.  Specifically, we assume that the braking/drag force $F_\\mathrm{d}$ will be proportional to the speed of the magnet.  This assumption makes sense because, if the magnet is moving fast, the magntic flux will be changing quickly (large $d\\Phi_B/dt$) and the induced emf will be large.  Thefore:\n",

Recall that a similar model was used for the drag force in PHYS 111 when you investigated the drag acting on a coffee filter dropped from some height above the ground.  Of course, there will also be kinetic friction between the magnet and copper track.  **Figure 6** shows a complete free-body diagram of the forces acting on the magnet as it slides down an inclined ramp.  $\\mu_\\mathrm{k}$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction, and $\\vec{N}$ is the normal force.\n",

    "Prior to the invention of liquid crystal displays (LCDs), **cathode ray tubes** (or **CRT**s) were the primary component in television sets. These simple devices were once ubiquitous - in fact, the first invention that might be recognized as a video game was the *cathode ray amusement device*, [patented in 1948 by Thomas Goldsmith](https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/gaming/a20129/the-very-first-video-game/). CRTs also have a profound legacy within physics -- experiments with cathode ray tubes led to the 1897 discovery of the electron by JJ Thomson. This discovery and a few other puzzling experimental and theoretical developments from the late 19th century would eventually culminate in the quantum revolution of the 1920s. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 12** shows a simplified diagram of a cathode ray tube. A tungsten heating element (much like the filament of an incandescent lightbulb) is used to heat up a nearby cathode, typically made from barium carbonate. A voltage source creates a slight excess of electrons in the cathode. The kinetic energy of these electrons increases with temperature until the most energetic electrons are released from the cathode in a process called **thermionic emission**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emitted cloud of electrons is concentrated into a beam and accelerated by an electric field. Magnetic fields established by deflecting coils are used to steer the beam as it is fired towards a phosphorescent screen which begins to glow a dull green. \n",
