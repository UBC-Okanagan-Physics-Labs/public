We have also seen that the standard deviation $\\sigma$ is used to estimate the uncertainty of any single trial of an experiment.  The physical interpretation is that any single measurement has a $68\\%$ chance of falling within one standard deviation of the mean $\\mu$.  In other words, each measurement has a $68\\%$ chance of falling between $\\mu-\\sigma$ and $\\mu+\\sigma$.\n",

You've observed this fact using simulated data in the pre-lab assignment and now experimentally by comparing two different sets of data with different numbers of trials.  \n",
