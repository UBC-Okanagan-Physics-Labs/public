The current at any point in the circuit is given by $I=dq/dt$, which represents the amount of charge $dq$ crossing a surface in time $dt$.

It is conventional to use capital $Q$ as the symbol for volume flow rate and we will need to take care not to confuse it with charge in electrical circuits which we will represent with a lowercase $q$.  It is pressure differences $\\Delta P$ that drive the flow of water in hydraulic circuits.  A pump is one way to establish a constant pressure difference in a hydraulic circuit.

    "Rather than using a pump, in your experiment the pressure difference will be supplied using a large vessel of water equipped with an outlet and valve near the bottom.

Once the valve is opened, water will flow through a narrow Teflon tube (i.e. the hydraulic resistor) and into a beaker that sits on a scale.  As long as the volume of water in the vessel is large compared to the amount of water collected by the beaker, the value of $\\Delta h$ will remain approximately constant during the experiment.  As a result the pressure difference $\\Delta P$ is also approximately constant and vessel of water acts as a hydraulic battery.\n",

The Teflon tube should also be relatively straight without any major bends or curves.  Arrange it so that the tube is straight *without* being stretched.  If the tube is stretched, its inner diameter will change which will adversely affect your data analysis.\n",
    "* In order to maintain a pressure of $1\\rm\\ atm$ above the water surface, the cap at the top of the water vessel should be removed while data is being collected.  To prevent accidental spills, please replace and tighten the cap when not actively collecting data.\n",
