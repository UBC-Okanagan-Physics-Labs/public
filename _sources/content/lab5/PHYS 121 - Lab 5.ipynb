    "### Draining the Hydraulic Capacitor\n",
    "\n",
    "When changing the Teflon tube, or when repeating a trial, you'll need to drain the water from the hydraulic capacitor/glass tube.  Follow these steps to drain the water without making a mess.\n",
    "\n",
    " - First, close the valve of the large water vessel.\n",
    " - Next, take the glass beaker at your station and hold it beneath the spout of the large water vessel and pull out the orange rubber stopper.\n",
    " - Keep the end of the Teflon tube/orange stopper above the beaker and lower them together so that the water quickly drains from the glass tube and into the beaker.\n",
    " - Next, hold the beaker beneanth the glass tube and pull the rubber stopper from the bottom of the glass tube.  Use the beaker to catch any remaining water that falls from the glass tube.\n",
    " - Use a towel to soak up any residual water clinging to the bottom of the glass tube.\n",
    " - Dump the water collected in the beaker back into the top of the water vessel.\n",
    " - Finally, replace the Teflon tube (or insert a new one) and start your next trial.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Measuring the Water Height vs Time\n",
    " \n",
    "For the largest Teflon tubes, the hydraulic capacitor will fill quickly (at least initially).  You and your partner can devise a strategy to collect high-quality data.  You may find it necessary to revise your strategy and repeat your data collection several times.  That's fine!  Getting good data on the first attempt has no real value.  What's most important is to be patient and persistent to ensure that you get a good dataset for the final trial!\n",
    " \n",
    "One strategy that you can consider trying is using your phone to record the water level as it rises.  This strategy will work best if you keep the height of your camera lens at approximately the same height as the top surface of the water filling the glass tube.  That is, rasie your phone at the same rate that the water level rises.  You can then play the video back at record heights and times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case its helpful, here are the links to the YouTube videos from Lab #4 that play beeps are regular time intervals.  Note, howver, for this lab it is not important for the measurements of the water height to be spaced equally in time.\n",
