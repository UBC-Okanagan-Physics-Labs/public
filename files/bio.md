#### **Larita Kipkeu**

I'm a third-year electrical engineering student. My true passion lies in creating sustainable and inclusive designs that can have a positive impact on communities. I firmly believe that through my work, I can contribute to making the world a better place. One of the things I absolutely love is collaborating with diverse teams. There's something truly magical about working with people from different backgrounds and hearing their unique perspectives. I find immense value in learning from others and appreciating the wide range of viewpoints that come together to create innovative solutions. When I have some free time, you'll often find me exploring new places, especially nature trails and hiking spots. Being out in nature allows me to disconnect from the hectic world and find inspiration in its breathtaking beauty. These experiences rejuvenate my mind and provide me with fresh ideas and insights that I can bring into different things I partake in. <br><br><br>
